# I-to-B-and-distance-parameters-in-neural-tissue
---

This Python script calculates the electric current (in picoamperes) generated by a magnetic field (in femtotesla) at a specified distance from a neuron. The calculations are based on the equations derived in the associated paper (reference #13).

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you need to have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- A Python environment with the `math` module available.

## Getting Started

1. **Running the Code**:

   - Copy the code into a Python environment or a Python file (e.g., `magnetic_field_to_current.py`).
   - Execute the script using your preferred Python environment.

2. **Input Values**:

   - The program will prompt you to enter the magnetic field strength (MF) and the distance from the neuron (in nanometers).
  
   ```python
   Enter the MF (in femtotesla): [enter_value]
   Enter the distance from the neuron (in nanometers): [enter_value]
   ```

3. **Viewing the Results**:

   - The script will calculate the electric current (I) and display the result in picoamperes.
  
   ```python
   The electric current (I) calculated is: [result] picoamperes
   ```

## Usage Tips

- Ensure you provide accurate values for the magnetic field strength (MF) and the distance from the neuron (r) based on your data or measurements.
- The calculation assumes a fixed value of Î¼ (mu) for neural tissue. Review and adjust this value if necessary.
