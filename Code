# I-to-B and distance parameters in neural tissue

# Run in PyCharm Environment

import math

# Input values (this eigenvalues can be determined and inserted by machine or user to predict the simulation)
B = float(input("Enter the MF (in femtotesla): "))

# In this section, we have assumed the distance value to be 5000 nm or 5 µm (based on the paper data, reference #13) 
r = float(input("Enter the distance from the neuron (in nanometers): "))

# Define the μ of neural tissue in T·m/A (Our last calculations on paper determined this value, based on data published in cited paper)
mu_0 = 3.14 * 10**-7  # Value of μ₀ in T·m/A

# Calculate the current in Amperes (we assumed that if there are distinct MF data from a neuron measured by sensors, such as NFIF, this code calculate the I eigenvalue for that neuron)
I = (B * 2 * math.pi * r * 10**-9) / mu_0  # Multiply by 10^-18 to convert femto to pico

# Output the result
print("The electric current (I) calculated is:", I, "picoamperes")
